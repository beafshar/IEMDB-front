# IEMDB – Static HTML/CSS Frontend

This repository contains the static HTML and CSS templates for the IMDB-like movie platform, developed as part of the **Internet Engineering** course at the **University of Tehran** (Spring 2022).

These templates were used in the early phases of development to prototype the UI and support backend integration.

## Features
- Clean, responsive design for movie and actor pages
- Static templates for user login, signup, watchlists, and more
- Developed as part of the initial frontend requirements for backend testing

## Notes
- This is a static-only frontend with no dynamic behavior or JavaScript functionality.
- Used for early development and UI testing in the project’s backend integration phase.
